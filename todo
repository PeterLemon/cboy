TODO

Before release:
  * Make save files have correct filenames (since 2012-04-11)
  * Sprite priority (since 2012-06-02)
  * HDMA could use a look (since 2012-06-02)
  * Double-speed mode (since 2012-06-02)
  * Fix save RAM. The emulated size is wrong in certain cases, save files are the wrong size, some MBCs don't save at all, etc. FIX IT. (since 2012-11-23)
